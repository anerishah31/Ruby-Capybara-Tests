# Ruby Capybara Tests
[//]: # "[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Ruby-RSpec-Selenium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saucelabs-sample-test-frameworks/Ruby-RSpec-Selenium)"

Your tests and testing environments may require you to modify this project. 
For questions regarding Sauce Labs integration, please see the [Sauce Labs documentation](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/). 
This project is not maintained by Sauce Labs Support.


## Purpose
Use this project as example code if you have an existing Capybara implementation, or if
you have an existing Rails application and the developers who will be creating and 
implementing the new test suite have experience with Capybara.

If you do not have an existing project and would like to use Ruby, 
it is recommended to look at the [Watir Tests Repo](https://github.com/titusfortner/Ruby-Watir-Tests). 

If you already have an existing test suite and are just looking to add Sauce Labs 
functionality to that project, or if you need to run tests on a mobile application,
take a look at the [Ruby Example Tests](http://www.notimplementedyet.com) project.
